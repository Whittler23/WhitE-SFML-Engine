# WhitE SFML Engine

WhitE is a C++ game engine based on the SFML library in 2.5.1 version. The project is targeted for developing 2D games. It should offer handling of basic modules associated with game development. I decided to start development of this engine as an experiment. In many places I am going to use experience gained in SPC-Some-Polish-Coders.
